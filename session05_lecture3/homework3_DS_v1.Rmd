# Money in UK politics

[The Westminster Accounts](https://news.sky.com/story/the-westminster-accounts-12786091), a recent collaboration between Sky News and Tortoise Media, examines the flow of money through UK politics. It does so by combining data from three key sources:

1.  [Register of Members’ Financial Interests](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-members-financial-interests/),
2.  [Electoral Commission records of donations to parties](http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Search/Donations), and
3.  [Register of All-Party Parliamentary Groups](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-all-party-party-parliamentary-groups/).

You can [search and explore the results](https://news.sky.com/story/westminster-accounts-search-for-your-mp-or-enter-your-full-postcode-12771627) through the collaboration’s interactive database. Simon Willison [has extracted a database](https://til.simonwillison.net/shot-scraper/scraping-flourish) and this is what we will be working with. If you want to read more about [the project’s methodology](https://www.tortoisemedia.com/2023/01/08/the-westminster-accounts-methodology/).

## Open a connection to the database

The database made available by Simon Willison is an `SQLite` database

```{r 1}
sky_westminster <- DBI::dbConnect(
  drv = RSQLite::SQLite(),
  dbname = here::here("data", "sky-westminster-files.db")
)
```

How many tables does the database have?

```{r 2}
DBI::dbListTables(sky_westminster)
```

## Which MP has received the most amount of money?

You need to work with the `payments` and `members` tables and for now we just want the total among all years. To insert a new, blank chunk of code where you can write your beautiful code (and comments!), please use the following shortcut: `Ctrl + Alt + I` (Windows) or `cmd + option + I` (mac)

```{r 3}
# Read the payments and members tables into data frames
payments <- dplyr::tbl(sky_westminster, "payments")
members <- dplyr::tbl(sky_westminster, "members")

# Join the payments and members tables
member_joined_data <- payments %>%
  inner_join(members, by = c("member_id" = "id"))

# Calculate the total amount of donations to an MP
total_amount_by_mp <- member_joined_data %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarize(total_amount = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_amount)) %>%
  collect() %>% 
  mutate(name = fct_reorder(name, total_amount)) %>% 
  head(10) 

# Plot the top 10
ggplot(total_amount_by_mp) +
  aes(y = name, x = total_amount) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_bw() +
  NULL
  
```

## Any `entity` that accounts for more than 5% of all donations?

Is there any `entity` whose donations account for more than 5% of the total payments given to MPs over the 2020-2022 interval? Who are they and who did they give money to?
```{r 4}
# Calculate the total amount donations made by an entity
most_donations <- member_joined_data %>% 
  group_by(entity) %>% 
  summarise(total_amount = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(perc_donation = total_amount/sum(total_amount)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(perc_donation)) %>% 
  
  # Filter for entities accounting for more than 5% 
  filter(perc_donation >= 0.05)
print(most_donations)

# To find out the recipient of those donations, I left join with the original dataframe
recipient_entity <- most_donations %>% 
  left_join(member_joined_data, by = "entity") %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(amt_recieved = sum(value))
print(recipient_entity)
```

## Do `entity` donors give to a single party or not?

-   How many distinct entities who paid money to MPS are there?
```{r 5}
# Count the number of distinct entities
distinct_entities <- member_joined_data %>%
  count(entity) %>% 
  collect() %>% 
  nrow()
print(distinct_entities)
```

-   How many (as a number and %) donated to MPs belonging to a single party only?
```{r 6}
# Group by entity and check the number of unique parties they have donated to
single_party_donors <- member_joined_data %>%
  group_by(entity) %>%
  filter(n_distinct(party_id) == 1) %>%
  summarise(total_donations = n())

# Calculate the count and percentage
single_party_donors_count <- nrow(single_party_donors)
total_donors_count <- member_joined_data %>%
  select(entity) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  nrow()

percentage_single_party_donors <- (single_party_donors_count / total_donors_count) * 100

# Print the results
single_party_donors_count
percentage_single_party_donors

```

## Which party has raised the greatest amount of money in each of the years 2020-2022?

I would like you to write code that generates the following table.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "total_donations_table.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r 7}
party_summary <- party_joined_data %>%
  mutate(date = lubridate::date(date),
         year = lubridate::year(date)) %>% 
  
  group_by(year, name) %>% 
  summarise(total_year_donations = sum(value)) %>% 
  mutate(prop = total_year_donations/sum(total_year_donations)) %>% 
  collect()
print(party_summary)
```

... and then, based on this data, plot the following graph.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "total_donations_graph.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r 8}
party_summary %>% 
  mutate(name = fct_reorder(name, prop, .desc = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = year, y = total_year_donations, fill = name) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Conservatives have captured the majority of political donations",
       subtitle = "Donations to political parties, 2020-2022",
       x = NULL,
       y = NULL)
```

This uses the default ggplot colour pallete, as I dont want you to worry about using the [official colours for each party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Index_of_United_Kingdom_political_parties_meta_attributes). However, I would like you to ensure the parties are sorted according to total donations and not alphabetically. You may even want to remove some of the smaller parties that hardly register on the graph. Would facetting help you?

Finally, when you are done working with the databse, make sure you close the connection, or disconnect from the database.

```{r 9}
dbDisconnect(sky_westminster)
```

# Anonymised Covid patient data from the CDC

We will be using a dataset with [anonymous Covid-19 patient data that the CDC publishes every month](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4). The file we will use was released on April 11, 2023, and has data on 98 million of patients, with 19 features. This file cannot be loaded in memory, but luckily we have the data in `parquet` format and we will use the `{arrow}` package.

## Obtain the data

The dataset `cdc-covid-geography` in in `parquet` format that {arrow}can handle. It is \> 600Mb and too large to be hosted on Canvas or Github, so please download it from dropbox <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q1yk8mmnbbrzavl/AAAxzRtIhag9Nc_hODafGV2ka?dl=0> and save it in your `dsb` repo, under the `data` folder

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false


tic() # start timer
cdc_data <- open_dataset(here::here("data", "cdc-covid-geography"))
toc() # stop timer


glimpse(cdc_data)
```
```{r 10}
# Set the temporary directory for DuckDB
dbExecute(con, "SET temp_directory='C:/Users/Divij/Desktop/mydsb2024/temp'")

# Connect to DuckDB and create a persistent database
con <- dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), dbdir = "cdc_data.db")

# Load the Parquet data into DuckDB
dbExecute(con, "CREATE TABLE cdc_data AS SELECT * FROM parquet_scan('C:/Users/Divij/Desktop/mydsb2024/data/cdc-covid-geography')")

# Verify the data structure
cdc_data <- tbl(con, "cdc_data")
glimpse(cdc_data)

```

Can you query the database and replicate the following plot?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid-CFR-ICU.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r 11}
# Filter and prepare the data
filtered_data <- cdc_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(age_group) & 
         !is.na(sex) & 
         !is.na(icu_yn) & 
         !is.na(death_yn) &
         death_yn != "Missing" &
         icu_yn != "Missing" &
         icu_yn != "Unknown" &
         sex != "Missing" &
         sex != "Unknown" &
         age_group != "Missing"
         ) %>%
  mutate(
    age_group = case_when(
      age_group == "0 - 17 years" ~ "0 - 17 years",

      age_group == "50 to 64 years" ~ "50 to 64 years",
      age_group == "65+ years" ~ "65+ years"
    ),
    sex = case_when(
      sex == "Female" ~ "Female",
      sex == "Male" ~ "Male"
    ),
    icu_yn = case_when(
      icu_yn == "Yes" ~ "Yes",
      icu_yn == "No" ~ "No"
    )
  ) %>%
  collect()

```

```{r 12}
# Ensure the filtered data is correctly converted to factors
filtered_data <- filtered_data %>%
  mutate(
    age_group = factor(age_group, levels = c("0 - 17 years", "18 to 49 years", "50 to 64 years", "65+ years")),
    sex = factor(sex, levels = c("Female", "Male")),
    icu_yn = factor(icu_yn, levels = c("Yes", "No"))
  )
```

```{r 13}
# Calculate CFR
cfr_data <- filtered_data %>%
  group_by(age_group, sex, icu_yn) %>%
  summarise(
    cases = n(),
    deaths = sum(death_yn == "Yes"),
    cfr = (deaths / cases) * 100,
    .groups = "drop"
  )
```

```{r 14}
# Create the custom labeller function
icu_labeller <- as_labeller(c("Yes" = "ICU Admission", "No" = "No ICU Admission"))

# Create the plot
ggplot(cfr_data, aes(x = age_group, y = cfr, label_number())) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", fill = "#F09481") +
  facet_grid(icu_yn ~ sex, labeller = labeller(icu_yn = icu_labeller)) +
  labs(
    title = "Covid CFR % by age group, sex and ICU Admission",
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL
  ) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(
    strip.text = element_text(size = 10)
  ) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(cfr, 1)), position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +
  coord_flip()
```

The previous plot is an aggregate plot for all three years of data. What if we wanted to plot Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) over time? Write code that collects the relevant data from the database and plots the following

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cfr-icu-overtime.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r 15}
filtered_data_new <- filtered_data %>%
  filter(age_group != "0 - 17 years") %>% 
  mutate(
    case_month = as.Date(paste0(case_month, "-01"))
  ) 
# Calculate CFR
cfr_data_new <- filtered_data_new %>%
  group_by(case_month, age_group, sex, icu_yn) %>%
  summarise(
    cases = n(),
    deaths = sum(death_yn == "Yes"),
    cfr = (deaths / cases) * 100,
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>% 
  filter(case_month != "2020-02-01")
```

```{r 16, fig.width=14, fig.height=10}

# Create the plot
ggplot(cfr_data_new, aes(x = case_month, y = cfr, color = age_group, group = age_group)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(cfr, 0)), vjust = -0.5, size = 3, check_overlap = TRUE) +
  facet_grid(icu_yn ~ sex, labeller = labeller(icu_yn = icu_labeller), scales = "free") +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y-%m", date_breaks = "1 month") +
  labs(
    title = "Covid CFR % by age group, sex and ICU Admission",
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    color = "Age Group",
    caption = "Source: CDC"
  ) +
  theme_light() +
theme(
    strip.text = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8),
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "right",
    legend.title = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 10)
  ) +
  NULL
```

For each patient, the dataframe also lists the patient's states and county [FIPS code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard_state_code). The CDC also has information on the [NCHS Urban-Rural classification scheme for counties](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm)

```{r}
urban_rural <- read_xlsx(here::here("data", "NCHSURCodes2013.xlsx")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 
```

Each county belongs in seix diffent categoreis, with categories 1-4 being urban areas and categories 5-6 being rural, according to the following criteria captured in `x2013_code`

Category name

1.  Large central metro - 1 million or more population and contains the entire population of the largest principal city
2.  large fringe metro - 1 million or more poulation, but does not qualify as 1
3.  Medium metro - 250K - 1 million population
4.  Small metropolitan population \< 250K
5.  Micropolitan
6.  Noncore

Can you query the database, extract the relevant information, and reproduce the following two graphs that look at the Case Fatality ratio (CFR) in different counties, according to their population?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cfr-county-population.png"), error = FALSE)

# Write the Excel data to DuckDB
dbWriteTable(con, "population_classification", population_classification, overwrite = TRUE)
```

```{r 18}
# Perform the join operation within DuckDB

# Money in US politics

In the United States, [*"only American citizens (and immigrants with green cards) can contribute to federal politics, but the American divisions of foreign companies can form political action committees (PACs) and collect contributions from their American employees."*](https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs)

We will scrape and work with data foreign connected PACs that donate to US political campaigns. The data for foreign connected PAC contributions in the 2022 election cycle can be found at <https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2022>. Then, we will use a similar approach to get data such contributions from previous years so that we can examine trends over time.

All data come from [OpenSecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org), a *"website tracking the influence of money on U.S. politics, and how that money affects policy and citizens' lives"*.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#| label: allow-scraping-opensecrets
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(robotstxt)
paths_allowed("https://www.opensecrets.org")

base_url <- "https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2022"

contributions_tables <- base_url %>%
  read_html() 

```

-   First, make sure you can scrape the data for 2022. Use janitor::clean_names() to rename variables scraped using `snake_case` naming.
```{r 25}
contributions_tables<- contributions_tables %>%
    html_node("table") %>%      # Assuming the data is in the first table on the page
    html_table(fill = TRUE)
  
  # Clean the variable names
  contributions <- contributions_tables %>%
    janitor::clean_names()
  
  # View the cleaned data
  head(contributions_clean)
```

-   Clean the data:

    -   Write a function that converts contribution amounts in `total`, `dems`, and `repubs` from character strings to numeric values.
    -   Separate the `country_of_origin_parent_company` into two such that country and parent company appear in different columns for country-level analysis.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# write a function to parse_currency
parse_currency <- function(x){
  x %>%
    
    # remove dollar signs
    str_remove("\\$") %>%
    
    # remove all occurrences of commas
    str_remove_all(",") %>%
    
    # convert to numeric
    as.numeric()
}

# clean country/parent co and contributions 
contributions <- contributions %>%
  separate(country_of_origin_parent_company, 
           into = c("country", "parent"), 
           sep = "/", 
           extra = "merge") %>%
  mutate(
    total = parse_currency(total),
    dems = parse_currency(dems),
    repubs = parse_currency(repubs)
  )
```

-   Write a function called `scrape_pac()` that scrapes information from the Open Secrets webpage for foreign-connected PAC contributions in a given year. This function should

    -   have one input: the URL of the webpage and should return a data frame.
    -   add a new column to the data frame for `year`. We will want this information when we ultimately have data from all years, so this is a good time to keep track of it. Our function doesn't take a year argument, but the year is embedded in the URL, so we can extract it out of there, and add it as a new column. Use the `str_sub()` function to extract the last 4 characters from the URL. You will probably want to look at the help for this function to figure out how to specify "last 4 characters".

```{r 26}

# Define the function
scrape_pac <- function(url) {
  # Check if scraping is allowed
  if (!paths_allowed(url)) {
    stop("Scraping is not allowed on this website.")
  }
  
  # Scrape the data
  contributions_tables <- url %>%
    read_html() %>%
    html_node("table") %>%      # Assuming the data is in the first table on the page
    html_table(fill = TRUE)
  
  # Clean the variable names
  contributions <- contributions_tables %>%
    janitor::clean_names()
  
  # Extract the year from the URL
  year <- str_sub(url, -4)
  
  # Add the year column
  contributions <- contributions %>%
    mutate(year = year)
  
  return(contributions)
}

```


-   Define the URLs for 2022, 2020, and 2000 contributions. Then, test your function using these URLs as inputs. Does the function seem to do what you expected it to do?
```{r 27}
# Define the URLs

url_2022 <- "https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2022"
url_2021 <- "https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2020"
url_2020 <- "https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2000"
print(scrape_pac(url_2022))
print(scrape_pac(url_2021))
print(scrape_pac(url_2020))
```


-   Construct a vector called `urls` that contains the URLs for each webpage that contains information on foreign-connected PAC contributions for a given year.
```{r 28}
urls <- c(url_2022, url_2021, url_2020)
```


-   Map the `scrape_pac()` function over `urls` in a way that will result in a data frame called `contributions_all`.
```{r 29}
# Map the function over the URLs and combine the results into a single dataframe
contributions_all <- map_df(urls, scrape_pac)
```


-   Write the data frame to a csv file called `contributions-all.csv` in the `data` folder.
```{r 30}
write_csv(contributions_all, here::here("data", "contributions-all.csv"))
```


# Scraping consulting jobs

The website [https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/](https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs) lists job openings for consulting jobs.

```{r}
#| label: consulting_jobs_url
#| eval: false

library(robotstxt)
paths_allowed("https://www.consultancy.uk") #is it ok to scrape?

base_url <- "https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/1"

listings_html <- base_url %>%
  read_html()

```

Identify the CSS selectors in order to extract the relevant information from this page, namely

1.  job
2.  firm
3.  functional area
4.  type

Can you get all pages of ads, and not just the first one, `https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/1` into a dataframe?

-   Write a function called `scrape_jobs()` that scrapes information from the webpage for consulting positions. This function should

    -   have one input: the URL of the webpage and should return a data frame with four columns (variables): job, firm, functional area, and type

    -   Test your function works with other pages too, e.g., <https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/2>. Does the function seem to do what you expected it to do?

    -   Given that you have to scrape `...jobs/page/1`, `...jobs/page/2`, etc., define your URL so you can join multiple stings into one string, using `str_c()`. For instnace, if `page` is 5, what do you expect the following code to produce?

```         
base_url <- "https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/1"
url <- str_c(base_url, page)
```

-   Construct a vector called `pages` that contains the numbers for each page available

-   Map the `scrape_jobs()` function over `pages` in a way that will result in a data frame called `all_consulting_jobs`.

-   Write the data frame to a csv file called `all_consulting_jobs.csv` in the `data` folder.

```{r 31}
# Check if scraping is allowed
if (paths_allowed("https://www.consultancy.uk")) {
  
  # Define the function to scrape jobs
  scrape_jobs <- function(url) {
    # Scrape the data
    listings_html <- url %>%
      read_html()
    
    # Extract the relevant information
    jobs <- listings_html %>% html_nodes(".title") %>% html_text(trim = TRUE)
    firms <- listings_html %>% html_nodes("td.hide-phone") %>% html_text(trim = TRUE)
    functional_areas <- listings_html %>% html_nodes("td.hide-tablet-and-less") %>% html_text(trim = TRUE)
    types <- listings_html %>% html_nodes("td.hide-tablet-landscape") %>% html_text(trim = TRUE)
    
     # Clean the functional_area values
    functional_areas <- functional_areas %>%
    str_replace_all("\\n", " ") %>% # Replace newline characters with space
    str_replace_all("\\+\\d+", "") %>% # Remove +1, +2, etc.
    str_squish() %>% # Remove extra whitespace
    str_replace_all(" ", ", ") # Separate values with ", "

    
    # Create a dataframe
    job_listings <- data.frame(
      job = jobs,
      firm = firms,
      functional_area = functional_areas,
      type = types,
      stringsAsFactors = FALSE
    )
    
    return(job_listings)
  }
  
  # Define the base URL
  base_url <- "https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/"
  
  # Create a vector of pages 
  pages <- 1:6
  
  # Construct the URLs
  urls <- str_c(base_url, pages)
  
  # Map the function over the URLs and combine the results into a single dataframe
  all_consulting_jobs <- map_df(urls, scrape_jobs)
  
  # Write the dataframe to a CSV file in the data folder
  write_csv(all_consulting_jobs, here::here("data", "all_consulting_jobs.csv"))
  
} else {
  print("Scraping is not allowed on this website.")
}

# Deliverables

There is a lot of explanatory text, comments, etc. You do not need these, so delete them and produce a stand-alone document that you could share with someone. Knit the edited and completed R Markdown (Rmd) file as a Word or HTML document (use the "Knit" button at the top of the script editor window) and upload it to Canvas. You must be commiting and pushing your changes to your own Github repo as you go along.

# Rubric

13/13: Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output. Multiple Github commits. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.

8/13: Problem set is 60--80% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). A few Github commits.

5/13: Problem set is less than 60% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often. Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. No Github commits.
